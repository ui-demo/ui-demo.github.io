	<p><strong>Note : </strong> Inside the css file - English, Hindi, Urdu, Tamil, Telugu and Kannada (Total 6 ) fonts are declared and even their classes have been created. But since some of the classes are not used anywhere inside html file, their fonts files are not downloaded. Observe in network tab, fonts for telugu and kannada were not downloaded even though they are declared in CSS file.</p>
	<p><strong>Moral of the story is </strong>- We can declare multiple fonts in a single CSS file. Fonts files will be downloaded only if it is used somewhere in the html.</p>
